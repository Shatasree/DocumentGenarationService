NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft.
 It is powerful, flexible, and can be adapted to a broad range of uses. 
 Every .NET developer should be at least proficient either in using VB.NET or C#, 
 or even better, both languages. The great .NET developer should be capable of
 handling many aspects of the application, including but not limited to performance,
 scalability, security, and testing. A fully knowledgeable . NET developer can use .
 NET to build a highly distributed web application, a sophisticated desktop application,
 or even a modern mobile application. Additional knowledge about Mono is a plus,
 as the combination of .NET and Mono allows for an even a wider range of platforms to be targeted.
